# Small Scale Electronics

This repository holds various information, scripts, etc learned during building small scale electronics. Most of this was learned when building [newae.com](newae.com) and associated projects.

This will eventually be turned into a book form, and this repository will be the support material for certain chapters.

* `Barcoding` covers scripts for printers

## Book Plans

This book will cover how I built hardware at NewAE, which is a combination of low-cost, medium-cost, open-source, and propreitary designs. As such the book covers a fairly broad spectrum of tasks, along with advice I learned along the way.

The following topics will be covered - this isn't a definitive chapter list, but roughly expected to cover:

1. Introduction
2. Pricing & Business
3. Protecting your Idea
4. Patents
5. Prototyping Basics
6. Prototyping with SMD
7. Repair & Rework
8. Static Control
9. PPE, Cleaning, and Parts Storage
10. Production Soldering & Assembly
11. PCB Design for Small Scale Manufacturing
12. Contract Manufactures
13. Testing & QA
